# Phase 1

The following steps make up the minimal viable product (MVP)

1. Home screen
    - Create new roster
    - Load existing roster
    - Settings (placeholder for later)

2. Roster Builder
    - Choose warband faction
    - Add/Remove units
    - Show points total
    - Limit to max points
    - Tap a unit -> show its stats/abilities

3. Roster view
    - Clean list view
    - Export to PDF or save locally (advanced/later)

4. Offline-first (no account needed)

# Phase 2 - Make it look good
    - Add icones and visuals per unit (gear, type, etc)
    - Color themes based on warband
    - Animations / Transitions
    - Unit filtering / sorting

# Phase 3 - Advaned features
    - Save / Load rosters to local storage
    - Custom warbands (user-defined)
    - Share roster links or QR codes
    - Campaign / XP tracking
    - Print / Export PDF
